## Gameplay

The gameplay involves you(the Player) moving around interacting with things, talking with people, etc. Fights and abilities are handled in this combat scene where the player types words in order to perform actions or prevent enemy actions from occurring.

There will be an in game menu where the player can save, change gear, and exit to the title screen. Saving saves current area, current chapter, current position, and other important events the Player has triggered. Changing gear allows you to select what armor you're wearing, as well as which 4 actions you want to use in battle. Each item and ability can be an action. That means food items take up an entire slot and can only be used once. However, they will heal, like, a lot. Also, I'm gonna nerf the current "Heal" ability. A lot.

If the player at any time has no actions, the "run away" action will be automatically equipped/selected.

## Characters

#### Alex (The Player)

Alex is a university student studying writing. They have insecurities about their ability to write and look to others for validation. When alone they often criticize their own work and become desperate to prove themselves.

Their name will be chosen by the Player, but "Alex" will be the default name, because its androgynous.

Thematically parallel to Holden Caulfield from Catcher in the Rye.

Not the best person. Overly critical of those around them, often taking compliments the wrong way, which doesn't help his insecurities about writing. Maybe even a bit paranoid of others, as well. Shows signs of each of the three dark triad personality traits (narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy).

#### Professor Caulfield

Their name is a reference to Catcher in the Rye, but they are actually thematically parallel to Mr.Spencer. They are attempting to be a role model/father figure for the Player, but don't understand the Player's motives and berates them for their actions. With good intentions, -ish.

#### The Demons

I really need to get some names for these guys. Alright, so there are two demons, and they have been tasked with tormenting the Player, and have decided to do so through the medium of puzzles. But it's not really torment, and the demons themselves provide comic relief whilst the Player completes the challenges.

The first demon is older, and experienced. They enjoy puzzles for the sake of puzzles, and make them difficult and lethal and mean. Of course, still enjoyable, I just mean relative to the other demon's puzzles, these are terrifically difficult. Takes inspiration from GlaDOS in Portal.

The other demon is younger, a trainee. New to the field, new to the other demon, and in general just inexperienced. Likes the Player, though. Their puzzles are basic and overtly simple, but they're trying. They get satisfaction from seeing the Player struggle to solve their puzzles, and even more from seeing the Player eventually overcome them anyways. At one point they should try re-using the same puzzle multiple times for the enjoyment factor, before realizing it doesn't work when the Player already knows what to do. Takes inspiration from Wheatley in Portal.

## Story

Like most RPGs, the game focuses on the story. Indeed, that combat system mentioned above heavily ties in with the story of the game. I also feel like the game should take inspiration from Catcher in the Rye, since most games also tend to do that (like Undertale did with Alice in Wonderland). Also, the game will be split into 5 chapters, separated by bosses.

#### Chapter 1

The game begins in the overworld. The Player is in class, and Professor Caulfield (reference to CitR) is concluding their lesson. This scene is to introduce the professor and get some development in early, as they will re-appear frequently throughout the game. They will also call roll, at which point the game will ask for the Player's name.

> ... and that concludes the theory of framing. I'll see you all next week.

> Oh! Before you go, I must call roll. Please raise your hand as I call your name.

The next scene shows the Player in their apartment, struggling to write. Eventually they say something along the lines of

> I would do anything just to be able to write!

and who would show up but Satan himself? Satan convinces the Player to sign a deal for their soul in exchange for the power to rewrite the world as they see it. Satan then shows the Player how to use their new power in a play fight. The Player will lose, and then Satan reveals he's taking the Player's soul immediately, and sends them to Hell.

> It's time to collect!

> What?! Aren't you supposed to wait until I'm... well, dead?

> Dude, I'm, like, literally Satan. Fuck you.

The player wakes up in an empty corridor, with only one exit. Approaching the exit, two demons appear. Their job is to torment the Player and all others who enter Hell, and do so using puzzles. They will bring puzzle after puzzle to the Player and force the Player to complete them, while providing comic relief as the Player does so. Some puzzles will just have the player alone, some will have just one demon, and finally some will have both. At the end of all these puzzles is a town. When the Player enters the town guards take them to the throne room. In the throne room is Boss #1.

The bosses are demons. Defeating the demons gives the Player new abilities, which they'll need if they hope to escape Hell.

Before you can battle the boss, a guy stops you in the throne room and goes

> nnnmmnmnmmnmnmnmmnnmnmm

and then attacks you. His attack is a bombardment of "n" and "m"s. Then you can fight the boss- this boss has the ability to make portals, and uses them in his attacks.

After beating the boss, the boss will explain there is a portal in this throne room that allows people to enter a small area on the overworld. The player gains the ability to enter the portal. As mentioned under gameplay, abilities are also combat scenes. But instead of an enemy the words just appear, and missing any cancels the action. For now it'll be pretty easy to do, but every chapter this portal will become harder to use.

> This portal will allow you to return to the overworld. However, it is a very temporary arrangement, and you can't do it very often. Use your time wisely...

On the other side of the portal is the Professor. They will talk with the Player, and express their disappointment in the Player's actions (dealing with the devil). During this conversation the Player will think to themselves that the professor is something derogatory, like how Holden in CitR considers many people around him "posers".

> You're dealing with the devil?! I thought I taught you better than that.

> :thought_balloon: What a poser...

#### Chapter 2

The Player will return to Hell, and can now explore the town. The town is a hub, with shops and hopefully subplots and stuff. In this town will be a pile of 132 stones, and a guy that calls you a nerd and runs away. There is a town/dungeon combo to the North, East, and South, and each triggers the next chapter. Each of those areas will have a theme, sort of like Majora's Mask. You will gain abilities from each dungeon's boss that allow you to go to the next one.

There will be teleporters between towns that only work after you've gone to the town once. There will be more stores and subplots, but probably fewer. Drew L. might make a subplot about a nonbinary couple where one tells truths and the other lies. Sounds incredibly cliché.

Subplot involving a loner

A musician who creates words that then move like a music visualizer

Following the guy that calls you a maze will bring you across a puzzle, an invisible maze where you need to follow in the footsteps of the guy, like those puzzles in every Zelda game. Doing so will bring you to the second dungeon.

I feel there should be some encounter/subplot where the correct solution is to run away. Another subplot idea I had is a guy that wants to be some sort of warrior and names the Player their nemesis. At first they just run away after getting hit once, and will reappear over the course of the game stronger and braver. In the Righteous ending (NG+) your first attack against him crits and he just dies there, with no dialogue.

There will then be a dungeon. There will be more puzzles by the demons, and then another boss. Also after you defeat the boss, Satan will come down and mention he's perturbed at our strength growing, and will "rewrite the game" to make it harder. He'll add random encounters all over the map. :)

```
New Ability:
Place bombs
```

It should be mentioned now that these abilities you get after each boss will have uses all over the map, including in previous areas. And, of course, they'll unlock the path for the next dungeon. They can also be used as attacks.

#### Chapter 3

After returning to the hub world, the Player can go through the portal again. It'll be a different place each time, but some characters might persist between meetings. These meetings with the overworld are really where I'm expecting the CitR influence to be most heavy. A lot of CitR is about Holden talking to different people in his life, and I think that should be what the Player should be doing. I just don't know who these discussions should be with or about.

I also don't know what puzzles will appear here, (but there will be puzzles, from the demons) or the theme for the town or dungeon. Sorry \*shrug\*. I do know this will be the dungeon to the south, and it'll be blocked by a cracked rock that can be blown up with the Player's newfound ability.

I think the subplot/theme for this chapter should be a parallel to CitR's prostitute scene. People will start questioning how the Player hopes to defeat Satan by merely getting these abilities (over chapters 1-3), and the Player starts doubting themselves (in chapter 3). In desperation they buy into some scammer with promises of powers that could actually match Satan's. Maybe also make it require something of the Player's that sacrifices some virtue or moral (maybe the scammer wants the Player's soul now that Satan wouldn't need it, almost like a Ponzi scheme). But the Player realizes what they're doing and doesn't go through with it, and the scammer attempts to take their payment anyways, through force. They're the boss, obviously.

> Exactly how is getting these abilities helping you leave Hell? Do you a mere cracked rock between us and the overworld? No? Of course not, you're in Hell. There is no escape. #deal

After defeating the boss Satan will once again appear and make the world a more dangerous place. I think he should also make it visibly "redder", and I'm thinking of also making some sort of shader that will make the world look slightly wavy to, like you see above hot pavement.

```
New Ability:
Telekinesis (works on very large objects)
```

#### Chapter 4

This town is to the East. It's society revolves around a judiciary system. Everything, from shopping to fighting to, well, everything, takes place in a court house. Instead of attacks the Player will use legal types of things like "Legal Document" (words like "DMCA", "take-down", "cease and desist", "divorce", etc.) or "Discovery" or something.

The Player will be charged with some crime upon entering the city, and in lieu of a boss battle the Player must plead their case in court. They are told to prepare themselves and the demons (who are fairly friendly by this point) tell the Player they know where some important document or something is, but of course it's at the end of a dungeon full of puzzles and enemies.

Then the Player can enter the court house to do the boss battle. The court house won't let the Player bring in any weapons, so they have to rely on their legal attacks.

Defeating this boss will also enrage Satan, who will basically scorch the entire ground of Hell, and "re-write the game" so that the hub town is now a dungeon.

```
New Ability:
Teleport to the other side of 1 block wide walls
```

#### Chapter 5

The Player will return to the hub town, and there will still be shops there and no one died. It's just that they're now in a dungeon instead of a town. The Player will come and kill Satan, go back to the overworld, and live happily ever after, Or something.

## New Game +

After beating the game once, you can play it again. This is the Righteous ending. You start with the level and gear that you ended the previous session with. Every enemy is significantly more difficult. For instance, the nmnmn guy will now have words of "n"s and "m"s, and all the bosses will have a second stage where they add a second attack that both fire simultaneously. But even the first stage will be different than the normal mode. The bosses will be completely different entities, and there'll be a new story connecting them all. You'll actually kill Satan in that first fight with him. Also, running away will be disabled in NG+.
