# Red Pen
A typing RPG about a writer who sells their soul to the Devil in exchange for extraordinary writing abilities.

## Gameplay
The Player traverses areas solving puzzles and interacting with characters. There is a focus on character development and subplots, and universe building.

Fights and abilities take place in a battle scene. Each round of battle has two phases. The first phase has the Player choose their action, and in the second phase, the combat phase, the Player must simultaneously perform their actions while defending from the enemy's. Words appear on the screen for every attack, and the Player must type them to "activate" them. However, some words activate if the Player _doesn't_ type them, like many enemy attacks. Sometimes the Player will have to use special abilities, which makes a battle without the first phase, where the Player only defends.

Each combat encounter is a unique experience built upon the core typing game mechanic. For instance, one enemy might attack with words that appear upside down or flipped, or with "armor" requiring the word to be typed multiple times, etc. Some of these special attacks will actually make them easier, generally for story related reasons. For instance words that grow shorter over time, or "break" after being partially typed.

Because they are unique, the encounters will probably be rarer than in other games. So, I don't think levels should be tied to encounters. Subplots and completing chapters will reward the Player with more life.

While exploring the world, here will be an in game menu where the player can save, change gear, and exit to the title screen. Saving saves current area, current position, and events the Player has triggered (such as completing a puzzle or beating a boss). Changing gear allows you to select which 5 actions you want to use in battle. Each item and ability can be an action. Currently there is no plan on single use items.

There is an action the Player can pick up that allows them to not attack the enemy. The enemy will still attack, but will also have a dialogue with the Player. If the Player continues sparing them, eventually the enemy will stop fighting back. However, it doesn't end the battle. Since there is no "run away" action or "mercy" or anything, the Player will have to end the battle some other way (usually by killing the opponent).

When the Player dies there will be a game over screen where there's some writer writing the game's story, which now says "... and then the Player died". But the writer then says to themselves

> No, that's not right... It went something more like...

And then loads the last save.

## Characters
### The Player
The Player is a university student studying writing. Intelligent, but misunderstood and misunderstanding. As a result they've become completely internally validating, that is, a narcissist. They're good at writing (according to others), but aren't satisfied with their own abilities. Throughout the game they struggle with finding a balance between internal versus external validation. Rewriting the world around them is them exposing themselves to external critique.

Their story arc ends when, at the end of the game, they return home and the Player sits down to work on their paper again and realized, without editing it, it's already good enough to publish. So they do.

Thematically parallel to Holden Caulfield from Catcher in the Rye. Like Holden, the Player will be a consummate liar, and will give each person they meet a different name. In addition to their narcissism, the Player also has some Machiavellian tendencies, which are not resolved in this story arc.

### Professor Caulfield
Their name is a reference to Catcher in the Rye, but they are actually thematically parallel to Mr.Spencer. They are attempting to be a role model/father figure for the Player, but don't understand the Player's motives and berates them for their actions. With good intentions, -ish.

Professor Caulfield only appears in the early parts of the game. The first scene, which will be a lecture discussing some thematic tools that happen to be in the game, and then when the Player goes through the portal at the end of chapter one.

Honestly, he's going to be a pretty flat character. His sole purpose is to show how the Player is misunderstood, but also misunderstanding.

### HABIT
There are two demons who have been tasked with tormenting anyone who enters Hell before dying, such as the Player, and have decided to do so through the medium of puzzles. But it's not really torment, and the demons themselves provide comic relief whilst the Player completes the challenges.

The first demon is older, and experienced. Their name is HABIT. They're passionate about puzzles and will spend a long time working on them. HABIT herself highly values order and actually makes their puzzles pretty simple and straightforward.

### Ned Trippy
The other demon is younger, a trainee, named Ned Trippy (N Trippy -> Entropy) New to the field, new to the other demon, and in general just inexperienced. Likes the Player, though. Their puzzles are overly complicated with chaotic and unnecessary parts that can actually just be completely ignored to reveal an incredibly simple and obvious answer. Ned appreciates the Player's ability to complete the puzzles so easily, but will say HABIT wanted the puzzles to take longer, so the Demon hangs with the Player and chats or something to pass the time. I'm not totally sure what to do during these sessions yet, but I'm sure I can have it help one of the themes of the game. For now, though, it's basically going to be the "Friendly Enemy" trope.

I don't know if it would be too cliche, but I think it'd be cool to have Ned be the power behind Satan in NG+, or at least someone secretly important and powerful (I'm worried about them being too much like sans from undertale though)

Initially HABIT will be surprised at how well Ned's puzzles stop the Player (comparatively to hers), and will at some point ask to watch the Player go through one of the puzzles, and the Player will be able to actually purposefully go a super long way to solve the puzzle to make Ned look good.

Another encounter will have HABIT burst in during one of Ned and the Player's chill sessions, and a confrontation ensues.

There are going to be other important characters, but I haven't gotten around to them yet

## Plot
Like most RPGs, the game focuses on the story. Indeed, that combat system mentioned above heavily ties in with the story of the game. I also feel like the game should take inspiration from Catcher in the Rye, since most games also tend to do that (like Undertale did with Alice in Wonderland). Also, the game will be split into 5 chapters, separated by bosses.

### Chapter 1
The game begins in the overworld. The Player is in class, and Professor Caulfield (reference to CitR) is concluding their lesson. They will be talking about some thematic element that appears in the game significantly.

> ... and that concludes the theory of framing [example]. I'll see you all next week.

The next scene shows the Player in their apartment, struggling to write. Eventually they say something along the lines of

> I would do anything just to be able to write!

but with a bigger focus on that they're unsatisfied with their own abilities. Then, Satan appears with a deal- the Player's soul in exchange for supernatural writing abilities. After convincing the Player to take the deal, Satan shows the Player how to use their new power in a tutorial fight. After that Satan reveals he's taking the Player's soul immediately, and sends them to Hell.

> It's time to collect your end of the deal!

> What?! Aren't you supposed to wait until I'm dead?

> Dude, I'm, like, literally Satan. Fuck you.

The player wakes up in an empty corridor. The Player wakes up, and HABIT appears. They warn the Player against continuing, but of course the Player continues anyway.

Before contiuing, there is actually a secret in the corridor room. To the north there is a wilting flower that gives the Player the spare action (see Gameplay for how it works).

When the Player enters the first puzzle HABIT calls the Player foolish, and explains the puzzle. There are two exits to the North and East. They are both blocked. There is a 5x5 grid of buttons, and HABIT tells the Player only one opens the exits. It zooms in dramatically as HABIT says

> The others. Do. Nothing. Hahahaha My trickery astounds even me! What's worse, the correct button will always be the last one you activate! Muaahaha

The camera will lock onto the puzzle whenever the Player is in the puzzle area. Solving the puzzle will move the camera to the exits and show them unlocking.

The exit to the top brings the  Player into a room with a scroll on a pedestal. Reading the scroll it says "HOW TO SPELL AWAY THE NMNMNMs", and gives the Player the "nm scroll" attack.

Scroll attacks are difficult but powerful spells. They make multiple words appear simultaneously, and each word moves fast, and must all be typed. The nm scroll, if casted successfully, "reverses" a nmnm's curse, and they no longer fight the Player and can talk English.

When the Player leaves the room there is a nm waiting for them outside, and attacks the Player. If the Player uses the scroll against nm, nm explains there are many nms around Hell and the Player should help lift their curses. They then suggest the Player probably wants a reward, and begrudgingly hands over a new weapon.

The next puzzle/encounter will be made by the younger demon. There will be several puzzles/encounters along the way to the town

The final encounter before entering the town will be HABIT again, citing all the time they spent (several millenia) on those puzzles and how easily the Player got through them as why HABIT now needs to fight the Player. They fight.

When the Player enters the town guards take them to the throne room. In the throne room is Boss #1.

The bosses are demons. Defeating the demons gives the Player new abilities, which they'll need if they hope to escape Hell.

After beating the boss, the boss will explain there is a portal in this throne room that allows people to enter a small area on the overworld. The player gains the ability to enter the portal. As mentioned under gameplay, abilities are also combat scenes. But instead of an enemy the words just appear, and missing any cancels the action. For now it'll be pretty easy to do, but every chapter this portal will become harder to use.

> This portal will allow you to return to the overworld. However, it is a very temporary arrangement, and you can't do it very often. Use your time wisely...

On the other side of the portal is the Professor. They will talk with the Player, and express their disappointment in the Player's actions (dealing with the devil). During this conversation the Player will think to themselves that the professor is something derogatory, like how Holden in CitR considers many people around him "posers".

> You're dealing with the devil?! I thought I taught you better than that.

> :thought_balloon: What a poser...

When the Player goes back through the portal the camera area doesn't change immediately. Professor Caulfield does a monologue that shows their own motives and illustrates that for as much as they didn't understand the Player, the Player didn't understand the Professor either.

When you return from the portal the first chapter will be over. This will be signified by showing the title, and possible having one of the characters talk to the Player, maybe referencing if the Player has played before and what they've done in those runs.

### Chapter 2
The Player will return to Hell, and can now explore the town. The town is a hub, with shops and hopefully subplots and stuff. In this town will be a pile of 132 stones, and a guy that calls you a nerd and runs away. There is a town/dungeon combo to the North, East, and South, and each triggers the next chapter. Each of those areas will have a theme, sort of like Majora's Mask. You will gain abilities from each dungeon's boss that allow you to go to the next one.

There will be many encounters and subplots in all these different areas, but none of them are really set in stone. I just have a bunch of ideas atm.

Following the guy that calls you a maze will bring you across a puzzle, an invisible maze where you need to follow in the footsteps of the guy, like those puzzles in every Zelda game. Doing so will bring you to the second dungeon.

I think the subplot/theme for this chapter should be a parallel to CitR's prostitute scene. People will start questioning how the Player hopes to defeat Satan by merely getting these abilities, and the Player might even once again start doubting their own abilities. During the dungeon, the Player will in desperation buy into some scammer with promises of powers that could actually match Satan's. Maybe also make it require something of the Player's that sacrifices some virtue or moral (maybe the scammer wants the Player's soul now that Satan wouldn't need it, almost like a Ponzi scheme). But the Player realizes what they're doing and doesn't go through with it, and the scammer attempts to take their payment anyways, through force. They're the boss, obviously.

> Exactly how is getting these abilities helping you leave Hell? Do you a mere cracked rock between us and the overworld? No? Of course not, you're in Hell. There is no escape. #deal

There will be more puzzles by the demons, and then another boss. Also after you defeat the boss, Satan will come down and mention he's perturbed at our strength growing, and will "rewrite the game" to make it harder. He makes the areas more treacherous or something. He doesn't add random encounters, since I'm trying to make every encounter meaningful.

```
New Ability:
Place bombs
```

It should be mentioned now that these abilities you get after each boss will have uses all over the map, including in previous areas. And, of course, they'll unlock the path for the next dungeon. They can also be used as attacks.

### Chapter 3
After returning to the hub world, the Player can go through the portal again. It'll be a different place each time, but some characters might persist between meetings. These meetings with the overworld are really where I'm expecting the CitR influence to be most heavy. A lot of CitR is about Holden talking to different people in his life, and I think that should be what the Player should be doing. I just don't know who these discussions should be with or about.

This town is to the South. It's society revolves around a judiciary system. Everything, from shopping to fighting to, well, everything, takes place in a court house. Instead of attacks the Player will use legal types of things like "Legal Document" (words like "DMCA", "take-down", "cease and desist", "divorce", etc.) or "Discovery" or something.

The Player will be charged with some crime upon entering the city, and in lieu of a boss battle the Player must plead their case in court. They are told to prepare themselves and the demons (who are fairly friendly by this point) tell the Player they know where some important document or something is, but of course it's at the end of a dungeon full of puzzles and enemies.

Then the Player can enter the court house to do the boss battle. The court house won't let the Player bring in any weapons, so they have to rely on their legal attacks.

After defeating the boss Satan will once again appear and make the world a more dangerous place. I think he should also make it visibly "redder", and I'm thinking of also making some sort of shader that will make the world look slightly wavy to, like you see above hot pavement.

```
New Ability:
Telekinesis (works on very large objects)
```

### Chapter 4
This town is to the East. The theme for this chapter will be finding out why Satan wanted to give this deal. The Eastern town happens to have a lab or something that the Player explores in order to discover their motivation for making this deal with the Player. I don't know what that is, yet, but that's what'll go here. Whatever it is there'll definitely be references to it throughout the game. This should really tie some things together. Maybe also hint at a power above Satan, who is revealed in NG+.

Basically imagine this chapter like in Undertale how determination is a plot point for many different things, and it all gets tied together when exploring Alphys' lab. (so maybe not make mine a lab as well)

Defeating this boss will also enrage Satan, who will basically scorch the entire ground of Hell, and "re-write the game" so that the hub town is now a dungeon.

```
New Ability:
Teleport to the other side of 1 block wide walls
```

### Chapter 5
The Player will return to the hub town, and there will still be shops there and no one died. It's just that they're now in a dungeon instead of a town. The Player will come and kill Satan, go back to the overworld, and live happily ever after, Or something.

## New Game +
After beating the game once, you can play it again. This is the Righteous ending. You start with the level and gear that you ended the previous session with. Every enemy is significantly more difficult. The bosses will be completely different entities, and there'll be a new story connecting them all.

Each boss in NG+ will have a second stage where they attack with two abilities at the same time. After beating each one you gain their second ability (you already have the first from normal mode).

NG+ will start with a screen similar to the game over screen, where basically the old ending is written over into the beginning of NG+. After killing Satan, the Player is filled with a sense of Righteousness, and begins their quest to kill everything in Hell.

During the entirety of NG+ you'll refer to your quest as the Righteous ending, but at the end you'll make it so bad people have nowhere to go and end up in limbo forever, and you'll basically feel bad for giving all these people a fate worse than Hell, which of course doesn't even exist at that point. It's a sad ending.
