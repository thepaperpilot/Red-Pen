## Gameplay

The gameplay involves you(the Player) moving around interacting with things, talking with people, etc. Fights and abilities are handled in this combat scene where the player types words in order to perform actions or prevent enemy actions from occurring.

## Story

Like most RPGs, the game focuses on the story. Indeed, that combat system mentioned above heavily ties in with the story of the game. I also feel like the game should take inspiration from Catcher in the Rye, since most games also tend to do that (like Undertale did with Alice in Wonderland). Also, the game will be split into 5 chapters, separated by bosses.

I like androgynous names, and people seemed to like the protagonist in Undertale not having a definite gender, so I think our character should be called Alex (by default, let the Player name them).

### Chapter 1

The game begins in the overworld. The Player is in class, and Professor Caulfield (reference to CitR) is concluding their lesson. This scene is to introduce the professor and get some development in early, as they will re-appear frequently throughout the game.

The next scene shows the Player in their apartment, struggling to write. Eventually they say something along the lines of

> I would do anything just to be able to write!

and who would show up but Satan himself? Satan convinces the Player to sign a deal for their soul in exchange for the power to rewrite the world as they see it. Satan then shows the Player how to use their new power in a play fight. The Player will lose, and then Satan reveals he's taking the Player's soul immediately, and sends them to Hell.

The player wakes up in an empty corridor, with only one exit. Approaching the exit, two demons appear. Their job is to torment the Player and all others who enter Hell, and do so through puzzles. One of the demons has a GLaDOS-type personality. They love puzzles for the sake of puzzles and tend to make them difficult and lethal. The other demon will have more of a Wheatley-type personality. They will do simple, basic puzzles, and feel very good about themselves for how well they are tormenting the Player. Totally copy the whole "make the player do the same puzzle multiple times" joke, because that shit is hilarious.

After talking to the demons, the player will have to go through some of these puzzles, all the while interacting with the demon that made each puzzle, or both together. At the end of all these puzzles is a town. When the Player enters the town guards take them to the throne room. In the throne room is Boss #1.

After beating the boss, the boss will explain there is a portal in this throne room that allows people to enter a small area on the overworld. The player gains the ability to enter the portal. As mentioned under gameplay, abilities are also combat scenes. But instead of an enemy the words just appear, and missing any cancels the action. For now it'll be pretty easy to do, but every chapter this portal will become harder to use.

On the other side of the portal is the Professor. They will talk with the Player, and express their disappointment in the Player's actions (dealing with the devil). During this conversation the Player will think to themselves that the professor is something derogatory, like how Holden in CitR considers many people around him "posers".

*End Chapter*

### Chapter 2

The Player will return to Hell, and can now explore the town. The town is a hub, with shops and hopefully subplots and stuff. In this town will be a pile of 132 stones, and a guy that calls you a nerd and runs away. There is a town/dungeon combo to the North, East, and South, and each triggers the next chapter. Each of those areas will have a theme, sort of like Majora's Mask. You will gain abilities from each dungeon's boss that allow you to go to the next one.

Following this guy will bring you across a puzzle, an invisible maze where you need to follow in the footsteps of the guy. Doing so will bring you to the town of the second dungeon. There will be teleporters between towns that only work after you've gone to the town once. There will be more stores and subplots, but probably fewer.

There will then be a dungeon. There will be more puzzles by the demons, and then another boss. After defeating this boss the player will receive the power to place bombs (as an attack and an ability). It should be mentioned now that these abilities you get after each boss will have uses all over the map, including in previous areas. And, of course, they'll unlock the path for the next dungeon.

Also after you defeat the boss, Satan will come down and mention he's perturbed at our strength growing, and will "rewrite the game" to make it harder. He'll add random encounters all over the map. :)

*End Chapter*

### Chapter 3

After returning to the hub world, the Player can go through the portal again. It'll be a different place each time, but some characters might persist between meetings. These meetings with the overworld are really where I'm expecting the CitR influence to be most heavy. A lot of CitR is about Holden talking to different people in his life, and I think that should be what the Player should be doing. I just don't know who these discussions should be with or about.

I also don't know what puzzles will appear here, (but there will be puzzles, from the demons) or the theme for the town or dungeon. Sorry \*shrug\*. I do know this will be the dungeon to the south, and it'll be blocked by a cracked rock that can be blown up with the Player's newfound ability.

The Player's new ability for defeating this boss will be moving large objects telepathically. Woot. Hopefully there can be a few fun items the player can now reach by just bring the objects to them. See if you can make the objects larger as they're lifted into the area, if possible.

After defeating the boss Satan will once again appear and make the world a more dangerous place. I think he should also make it visibly "redder", and I'm thinking of also making some sort of shader that will make the world look slightly wavy to, like you see above hot pavement.

*End Chapter*

### Chapter 4

Similarly to chapter 3, I'm running out of ideas for each individual chapter. There'll be a town, with a dungeon. It's to the East.

After defeating the boss the Player will get the ability to teleport across 1 block thick walls. Defeating this boss will also enrage Satan, who will basically scorch the entire ground of Hell, and "re-write the game" so that the hub town is now a dungeon.

*End Chapter*

### Chapter 5

The Player will return to the hub town, and there will still be shops there and no one died. It's just that they're now in a dungeon instead of a town. The Player will come and kill Satan, go back to the overworld, and live happily ever after, Or something.

## Other Notes

You know how Undertale has multiple routes with fairly different stories and drastically different endings? I kinda like that idea. But, since you're in Hell, I think the "good" ending would be the "Righteous" ending, in which you kill literally everything in Hell. :)

The characters in the hub town, and potentially the satellite towns as well, should have different dialogues for each chapter of the game.
