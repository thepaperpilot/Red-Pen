# Thoughts
Just scrambled thoughts I've had that I eventually plan on forming into legit things and putting in the design doc. Nothing in here is polished or official or anything.

## General
- Ask `$EVERYONE` for animations through sprites
- Finish chapter one and polish like hell before moving onto chapter two
- Also start posting to reddit and stuff after chapter one (is it advertising when its FOSS?)
- If red pen gets popular, consider something like patreon to continue making FOSS games?
- I've been going back and forth working on the content or the engine, time to switch back to content
- Story board using [Twine](https://twinery.org/)?

## Attacks/People
- 7 vices but they're all perverted (as in, not the original vices)
- External validation battle? (at what point would this happen at? Since the Player is struggling to balance internal vs external validation)
- Words you need to type backwards or appear upside down?
- Battle focused on accuracy (enemy has no health, ends the battle after maintaining a certain accuracy over a certain time)
- Armored words you need to type multiple times? (or individual letters?)
- For a sad/weak attack, words whose letters fall off the end over time (and never complete/only need one letter)
- Fragile word where typing one letter breaks the whole word?
- Enemy who's attacks are all the number of deaths the Player has
- Enemy shoots Player with gun, Player can create walls by typing "up", "down", "left", "right" that protect against the shot but break
- Small words that appear in the same place each time for only a small amount of time, but warnings first (and same word each time)
- Word that explodes into more words if you type it
- Word that explodes, with another word underneath it/word with the same first letter to the side
- An attack where the words are all offset by one letter on the qwerty keyboard (or other ciphers?)
- Enemy who declares himself the Player's nemesis, and they fight every once in awhile, and the Player gets to see them progress and become stronger (initally veeery weak, and runs away after being hit once). In NG+ they'd be the first to die once the Player returns to Hell. Very nonchalantly.

## Story
- Protagonist "thinks" to the Player? To judge others and stuff?
- TV Tropes for inspiration? lol, just don't use cliches. Look at CiTR's list of tropes?
- Still no content for the second demon lol
- Make some ideas for long term subplots (akin to undertale's determination, with alphys' lab and stuff)
- Why did Satan make the deal? (conspiracy,experiment,etc?)
- Someone behind Satan giving instructions? (NG+?)

### Remaining for Chapter One
- School scene at the beginning
- More puzzles/encounters before arriving at town
- Throne cutscene
- Portal scene
- Title scene
- Lots of polish

## Gameplay
- Make a falling animation (and many others, ofc), and make the Player say "shiiiiiit" outside of a dialogue box
- Ability extends Battle (player doesn't attack, just defends)
- Make spare not end the battle, just make the enemy stop attacking (so player still needs to kill, fitting better with their character. Also add a string for enemies to say after )
- Make enemies say one thing per round, which sparing can override, size determined by contents (set width), and it keeps the combat phase from ending until it closes
